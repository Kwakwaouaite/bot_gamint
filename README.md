At the end the bot should be able to:
- Maintain a list of game for the server
- Create and manage a certain amount of channel for each game
- Manage the roles/permission to hide/display the channels to users

Do not forget to put your token in the data.json as:
{"token": "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"}

It is just in development but I'm working on it
